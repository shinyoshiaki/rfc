            Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing with NAT traversal. It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT. It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs and does not require any special behavior from them.

            The protocol defined in this specification, Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN), provides a tool for dealing with Network Address Translators (NATs). It provides a means for an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated by a NAT that corresponds to its private IP address and port. It also provides a way for an endpoint to keep a NAT binding alive. With some extensions, the protocol can be used to do connectivity checks between two endpoints [RFC8445] or to relay packets between two endpoints [RFC5766].

            STUN is intended to be used in the context of one or more NAT traversal solutions. These solutions are known as &#34;STUN Usages&#34;. Each usage describes how STUN is utilized to achieve the NAT traversal solution. Typically, a usage indicates when STUN messages get sent, which optional attributes to include, what server is used, and what authentication mechanism is to be used. Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC8445] is one usage of STUN. SIP Outbound [RFC5626] is another usage of STUN. In some cases, a usage will require extensions to STUN. A STUN extension can be in the form of new methods, attributes, or error response codes. More information on STUN Usages can be found in Section 13.

            One possible STUN configuration is shown in Figure 1. In this configuration, there are two entities (called STUN agents) that implement the STUN protocol. The lower agent in the figure is the client, which is connected to private network 1. This network connects to private network 2 through NAT 1. Private network 2 connects to the public Internet through NAT 2. The upper agent in the figure is the server, which resides on the public Internet.

            STUN is a client-server protocol. It supports two types of transactions. One is a request/response transaction in which a client sends a request to a server, and the server returns a response. The second is an indication transaction in which either agent -- client or server -- sends an indication that generates no response. Both types of transactions include a transaction ID, which

            is a randomly selected 96-bit number. For request/response transactions, this transaction ID allows the client to associate the response with the request that generated it; for indications, the transaction ID serves as a debugging aid.

            All STUN messages start with a fixed header that includes a method, a class, and the transaction ID. The method indicates which of the various requests or indications this is; this specification defines just one method, Binding, but other methods are expected to be defined in other documents. The class indicates whether this is a request, a success response, an error response, or an indication. Following the fixed header comes zero or more attributes, which are Type-Length-Value extensions that convey additional information for the specific message.

            This document defines a single method called &#34;Binding&#34;. The Binding method can be used either in request/response transactions or in indication transactions. When used in request/response transactions, the Binding method can be used to determine the particular binding a NAT has allocated to a STUN client. When used in either request/ response or in indication transactions, the Binding method can also be used to keep these bindings alive.

            In the Binding request/response transaction, a Binding request is sent from a STUN client to a STUN server. When the Binding request arrives at the STUN server, it may have passed through one or more NATs between the STUN client and the STUN server (in Figure 1, there are two such NATs). As the Binding request message passes through a NAT, the NAT will modify the source transport address (that is, the source IP address and the source port) of the packet. As a result, the source transport address of the request received by the server will be the public IP address and port created by the NAT closest to the server. This is called a &#34;reflexive transport address&#34;. The STUN server copies that source transport address into an XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute in the STUN Binding response and sends the Binding response back to the STUN client. As this packet passes back through a NAT, the NAT will modify the destination transport address in the IP header, but the transport address in the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute within the body of the STUN response will remain untouched. In this way, the client can learn its reflexive transport address allocated by the outermost NAT with respect to the STUN server.

            In some usages, STUN must be multiplexed with other protocols (e.g., [RFC8445] and [RFC5626]). In these usages, there must be a way to inspect a packet and determine if it is a STUN packet or not. STUN provides three fields in the STUN header with fixed values that can

            STUN defines a set of optional procedures that a usage can decide to use, called &#34;mechanisms&#34;. These mechanisms include DNS discovery, a redirection technique to an alternate server, a fingerprint attribute for demultiplexing, and two authentication and message-integrity exchanges. The authentication mechanisms revolve around the use of a username, password, and message-integrity value. Two authentication mechanisms, the long-term credential mechanism and the short-term credential mechanism, are defined in this specification. Each usage specifies the mechanisms allowed with that usage.

          <p class="text indent-3">
            In the long-term credential mechanism, the client and server share a pre-provisioned username and password and perform a digest challenge/ response exchange inspired by the one defined for HTTP [RFC7616] but differing in details. In the short-term credential mechanism, the client and the server exchange a username and password through some out-of-band method prior to the STUN exchange. For example, in the ICE usage [RFC8445], the two endpoints use out-of-band signaling to exchange a username and password. These are used to integrity protect and authenticate the request and response. There is no challenge or nonce used.

As such, the transaction ID MUST be uniformly and randomly chosen from the interval 0 .. 2**96-1 and MUST be cryptographically random. Resends of the same request reuse the same transaction ID, but the client MUST choose a new transaction ID for new transactions unless the new request is bit-wise identical to the previous request and sent from the same transport address to the same IP address. Success and error responses MUST carry the same transaction ID as their corresponding request. When an agent is acting as a STUN server and STUN client on the same port, the transaction IDs in requests sent by the agent have no relationship to the transaction IDs in requests received by the agent.

            When running STUN over UDP or STUN over DTLS-over-UDP [RFC7350], it is possible that the STUN message might be dropped by the network. Reliability of STUN request/response transactions is accomplished through retransmissions of the request message by the client application itself. STUN indications are not retransmitted; thus, indication transactions over UDP or DTLS-over-UDP are not reliable.

            A client SHOULD retransmit a STUN request message starting with an interval of RTO (&#34;Retransmission TimeOut&#34;), doubling after each retransmission. The RTO is an estimate of the round-trip time (RTT) and is computed as described in [RFC6298], with two exceptions. First, the initial value for RTO SHOULD be greater than or equal to 500 ms. The exception cases for this &#34;SHOULD&#34; are when other mechanisms are used to derive congestion thresholds (such as the ones defined in ICE for fixed-rate streams) or when STUN is used in non-Internet environments with known network capacities. In fixed-line access links, a value of 500 ms is RECOMMENDED. Second, the value of RTO SHOULD NOT be rounded up to the nearest second. Rather, a 1 ms accuracy SHOULD be maintained. As with TCP, the usage of Karn&#39;s algorithm is RECOMMENDED [KARN87]. When applied to STUN, it means that RTT estimates SHOULD NOT be computed from STUN transactions that result in the retransmission of a request.

            The value for RTO SHOULD be cached by a client after the completion of the transaction and used as the starting value for RTO for the next transaction to the same server (based on equality of IP address). The value SHOULD be considered stale and discarded if no transactions have occurred to the same server in the last 10 minutes.

            Retransmissions continue until a response is received or until a total of Rc requests have been sent. Rc SHOULD be configurable and SHOULD have a default of 7. If, after the last request, a duration equal to Rm times the RTO has passed without a response (providing ample time to get a response if only this final request actually succeeds), the client SHOULD consider the transaction to have failed. Rm SHOULD be configurable and SHOULD have a default of 16. A STUN transaction over UDP or DTLS-over-UDP is also considered failed if there has been a hard ICMP error [RFC1122]. For example, assuming an RTO of 500 ms, requests would be sent at times 0 ms, 500 ms, 1500 ms, 3500 ms, 7500 ms, 15500 ms, and 31500 ms.

            In some usages of STUN, STUN is the only protocol over the TCP connection. In this case, it can be sent without the aid of any additional framing or demultiplexing. In other usages, or with other extensions, it may be multiplexed with other data over a TCP connection. In that case, STUN MUST be run on top of some kind of framing protocol, specified by the usage or extension, which allows for the agent to extract complete STUN messages and complete application-layer messages. The STUN service running on the well-known port or ports discovered through the DNS procedures in Section 8 is for STUN alone, and not for STUN multiplexed with other data. Consequently, no framing protocols are used in connections to those servers. When additional framing is utilized, the usage will specify how the client knows to apply it and what port to connect to. For example, in the case of ICE connectivity checks, this information is learned through out-of-band negotiation between client and server.

            This section specifies the processing of a STUN message. The processing specified here is for STUN messages as defined in this specification; additional rules for backwards compatibility are defined in Section 11. Those additional procedures are optional, and usages can elect to utilize them. First, a set of processing operations is applied that is independent of the class. This is followed by class-specific processing, described in the subsections that follow.

            When a STUN agent receives a STUN message, it first checks that the message obeys the rules of Section 5. It checks that the first two bits are 0, that the Magic Cookie field has the correct value, that the message length is sensible, and that the method value is a supported method. It checks that the message class is allowed for the particular method. If the message class is &#34;Success Response&#34; or &#34;Error Response&#34;, the agent checks that the transaction ID matches a transaction that is still in progress. If the FINGERPRINT extension is being used, the agent checks that the FINGERPRINT attribute is present and contains the correct value. If any errors are detected, the message is silently discarded. In the case when STUN is being multiplexed with another protocol, an error may indicate that this is not really a STUN message; in this case, the agent should try to parse the message as a different protocol.

            When run over UDP or DTLS-over-UDP, a request received by the server could be the first request of a transaction or could be a retransmission. The server MUST respond to retransmissions such that the following property is preserved: if the client receives the response to the retransmission and not the response that was sent to the original request, the overall state on the client and server is identical to the case where only the response to the original retransmission is received or where both responses are received (in which case the client will use the first). The easiest way to meet this requirement is for the server to remember all transaction IDs received over UDP or DTLS-over-UDP and their corresponding responses in the last 40 seconds. However, this requires the server to hold state and is inappropriate for any requests that are not authenticated. Another way is to reprocess the request and recompute the response. The latter technique MUST only be applied to requests that are idempotent (a request is considered idempotent when the same request can be safely repeated without impacting the overall state of the system) and result in the same success response for the same request. The Binding method is considered to be idempotent. Note that there are certain rare network events that could cause the reflexive transport address value to change, resulting in a different mapped address in different success responses. Extensions to STUN MUST discuss the implications of request retransmissions on servers that do not store transaction state.

            If the URI does not contain an IP address, the domain name contained in the &lt;host&gt; part is resolved to a transport address using the SRV procedures specified in [RFC2782]. The DNS SRV service name is the content of the &lt;scheme&gt; part. The protocol in the SRV lookup is the transport protocol the client will run STUN over: &#34;udp&#34; for UDP and &#34;tcp&#34; for TCP.

When following these procedures, if the STUN transaction times out without receipt of a response, the client SHOULD retry the request to the next server in the order defined by RFC 2782. Such a retry is only possible for request/response transmissions, since indication transactions generate no response or timeout.

            This section defines two mechanisms for STUN that a client and server can use to provide authentication and message integrity; these two mechanisms are known as the short-term credential mechanism and the long-term credential mechanism. These two mechanisms are optional, and each usage must specify if and when these mechanisms are used. Consequently, both clients and servers will know which mechanism (if any) to follow based on knowledge of which usage applies. For example, a STUN server on the public Internet supporting ICE would have no authentication, whereas the STUN server functionality in an agent supporting connectivity checks would utilize short-term credentials. An overview of these two mechanisms is given in Section 2.

            Each mechanism specifies the additional processing required to use that mechanism, extending the processing specified in Section 6. The additional processing occurs in three different places: when forming a message, when receiving a message immediately after the basic checks have been performed, and when doing the detailed processing of error responses.

            The short-term credential mechanism assumes that, prior to the STUN transaction, the client and server have used some other protocol to exchange a credential in the form of a username and password. This credential is time-limited. The time limit is defined by the usage. As an example, in the ICE usage [RFC8445], the two endpoints use out-of-band signaling to agree on a username and password, and this username and password are applicable for the duration of the media session.

            The long-term credential mechanism relies on a long-term credential, in the form of a username and password that are shared between client and server. The credential is considered long-term since it is assumed that it is provisioned for a user and remains in effect until the user is no longer a subscriber of the system or until it is changed. This is basically a traditional &#34;log-in&#34; username and password given to users.

            Because these usernames and passwords are expected to be valid for extended periods of time, replay prevention is provided in the form of a digest challenge. In this mechanism, the client initially sends a request, without offering any credentials or any integrity checks. The server rejects this request, providing the user a realm (used to guide the user or agent in selection of a username and password) and a nonce. The nonce provides a limited replay protection. It is a cookie, selected by the server and encoded in such a way as to indicate a duration of validity or client identity from which it is valid. Only the server needs to know about the internal structure of the cookie. The client retries the request, this time including its username and the realm and echoing the nonce provided by the server. The client also includes one of the message-integrity attributes defined in this document, which provides an HMAC over the entire request, including the nonce. The server validates the nonce and checks the message integrity. If they match, the request is authenticated. If the nonce is no longer valid, it is considered &#34;stale&#34;, and the server rejects the request, providing a new nonce.

            A server using this extension redirects a client to another server by replying to a request message with an error response message with an error code of 300 (Try Alternate). The server MUST include at least one ALTERNATE-SERVER attribute in the error response, which MUST contain an IP address of the same address family as the source IP address of the request message. The server SHOULD include an additional ALTERNATE-SERVER attribute, after the mandatory one, that contains an IP address of the address family other than the source IP address of the request message. The error response message MAY be authenticated; however, there are use cases for ALTERNATE-SERVER where authentication of the response is not possible or practical. If the transaction uses TLS or DTLS, if the transaction is authenticated by a MESSAGE-INTEGRITY-SHA256 attribute, and if the server wants to redirect to a server that uses a different certificate, then it MUST include an ALTERNATE-DOMAIN attribute containing the name inside the subjectAltName of that certificate. This series of conditions on the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY-SHA256 attribute indicates that the transaction is authenticated and that the client implements this specification and therefore can process the ALTERNATE-DOMAIN attribute.

            A client using this extension handles a 300 (Try Alternate) error code as follows. The client looks for an ALTERNATE-SERVER attribute in the error response. If one is found, then the client considers the current transaction as failed and reattempts the request with the server specified in the attribute, using the same transport protocol used for the previous request. That request, if authenticated, MUST utilize the same credentials that the client would have used in the request to the server that performed the redirection. If the transport protocol uses TLS or DTLS, then the client looks for an ALTERNATE-DOMAIN attribute. If the attribute is found, the domain MUST be used to validate the certificate using the recommendations in [RFC6125]. The certificate MUST contain an identifier of type DNS-ID or CN-ID (eventually with wildcards) but not of type SRV-ID or URI-ID. If the attribute is not found, the same domain that was used for the original request MUST be used to validate the certificate. If the client has been redirected to a server to which it has already sent this request within the last five minutes, it MUST ignore the redirection and consider the transaction to have failed. This prevents infinite ping-ponging between servers in case of redirection loops.

            Historically, &#34;classic STUN&#34; [RFC3489] only defined the behavior of a server that was providing clients with server reflexive transport addresses by receiving and replying to STUN Binding requests. [RFC5389] redefined the protocol as an extensible framework, and the server functionality became the sole STUN Usage defined in that document. This STUN Usage is also known as &#34;Basic STUN Server&#34;.

            The STUN server MUST support the Binding method. It SHOULD NOT utilize the short-term or long-term credential mechanism. This is because the work involved in authenticating the request is more than the work in simply processing it. It SHOULD NOT utilize the ALTERNATE-SERVER mechanism for the same reason. It MUST support UDP and TCP. It MAY support STUN over TCP/TLS or STUN over UDP/DTLS; however, DTLS and TLS provide minimal security benefits in this basic mode of operation. It does not require a keep-alive mechanism because a TCP or TLS-over-TCP connection is closed after the end of the Binding transaction. It MAY utilize the FINGERPRINT mechanism but MUST NOT require it. Since the stand-alone server only runs STUN, FINGERPRINT provides no benefit. Requiring it would break compatibility with RFC 3489, and such compatibility is desirable in a stand-alone server. Stand-alone STUN servers SHOULD support backwards compatibility with clients using [RFC3489], as described in Section 11.

            It is RECOMMENDED that administrators of STUN servers provide DNS entries for those servers as described in Section 8. If both A and AAAA resource records are returned, then the client can simultaneously send STUN Binding requests to the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (as specified in [RFC8305]), as the Binding request is idempotent. Note that the MAPPED-ADDRESS or XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attributes that are returned will not necessarily match the address family of the server address used.

            Note: XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS and MAPPED-ADDRESS differ only in their encoding of the transport address. The former encodes the transport address by XOR&#39;ing it with the magic cookie. The latter encodes it directly in binary. RFC 3489 originally specified only MAPPED-ADDRESS. However, deployment experience found that some NATs rewrite the 32-bit binary payloads containing the NAT&#39;s public IP address, such as STUN&#39;s MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute, in the well-meaning but misguided attempt to provide a generic Application Layer Gateway (ALG) function. Such behavior interferes with the operation of STUN and also causes failure of STUN&#39;s message-integrity checking.

            Note: This specification uses the OpaqueString profile instead of the UsernameCasePreserved profile for username string processing in order to improve compatibility with deployed password stores. Many password databases used for HTTP and SIP Digest authentication store the MD5 hash of username:realm:password instead of storing a plain text password. In [RFC3489], STUN authentication was designed to be compatible with these existing databases to the extent possible, which like SIP and HTTP performed no pre-processing of usernames and passwords other than prohibiting non-space ASCII control characters. The next revision of the STUN specification, [RFC5389], used the SASLprep [RFC4013] stringprep [RFC3454] profile to pre-process usernames and passwords. SASLprep uses Unicode Normalization Form KC (Compatibility Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition) [UAX15] and prohibits various control, space, and non-text, deprecated, or inappropriate codepoints. The PRECIS framework [RFC8264] obsoletes stringprep. PRECIS handling of usernames and passwords [RFC8265] uses Unicode Normalization Form C (Canonical Decomposition, followed by Canonical Composition). While there are specific cases where different username strings under HTTP Digest could be mapped to a single STUN username processed with OpaqueString, these cases are extremely unlikely and easy to detect and correct. With a UsernameCasePreserved profile, it would be more likely that valid usernames under HTTP Digest would not match their processed forms (specifically usernames containing bidirectional text and compatibility forms). Operators are free to further restrict the allowed codepoints in usernames to avoid problematic characters.

            As with MESSAGE-INTEGRITY and MESSAGE-INTEGRITY-SHA256, the CRC used in the FINGERPRINT attribute covers the Length field from the STUN message header. Therefore, prior to computation of the CRC, this value must be correct and include the CRC attribute as part of the message length. When using the FINGERPRINT attribute in a message, the attribute is first placed into the message with a dummy value; then, the CRC is computed, and the value of the attribute is updated. If the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY or MESSAGE-INTEGRITY-SHA256 attribute is also present, then it must be present with the correct message-integrity value before the CRC is computed, since the CRC is done over the value of the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY and MESSAGE-INTEGRITY-SHA256 attributes as well.

            The ERROR-CODE attribute is used in error response messages. It contains a numeric error code value in the range of 300 to 699 plus a textual reason phrase encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629]; it is also consistent in its code assignments and semantics with SIP [RFC3261] and HTTP [RFC7231]. The reason phrase is meant for diagnostic purposes and can be anything appropriate for the error code. Recommended reason phrases for the defined error codes are included in the IANA registry for error codes. The reason phrase MUST be a UTF-8-encoded [RFC3629] sequence of fewer than 128 characters (which can be as long as 509 bytes when encoding them or 763 bytes when decoding them).

            An attacker can try to modify STUN messages in transit, in order to cause a failure in STUN operation. These attacks are detected for both requests and responses through the message-integrity mechanism, using either a short-term or long-term credential. Of course, once detected, the manipulated packets will be dropped, causing the STUN transaction to effectively fail. This attack is possible only by an on-path attacker.

            An attacker that can observe, but not modify, STUN messages in-transit (for example, an attacker present on a shared access medium, such as Wi-Fi) can see a STUN request and then immediately send a STUN response, typically an error response, in order to disrupt STUN processing. This attack is also prevented for messages that utilize MESSAGE-INTEGRITY. However, some error responses, those related to authentication in particular, cannot be protected by MESSAGE-INTEGRITY. When STUN itself is run over a secure transport protocol (e.g., TLS), these attacks are completely mitigated.

            Depending on the STUN Usage, these attacks may be of minimal consequence and thus do not require message integrity to mitigate. For example, when STUN is used to a basic STUN server to discover a server reflexive candidate for usage with ICE, authentication and message integrity are not required since these attacks are detected during the connectivity check phase. The connectivity checks themselves, however, require protection for proper operation of ICE overall. As described in Section 13, STUN Usages describe when authentication and message integrity are needed.

            To protect against this attack and other similar bid-down attacks, the nonce is enriched with a set of security bits that indicates which security features are in use. In the case of the selection of the password algorithm, the matching bit is set in the nonce returned by the server in the same response that contains the PASSWORD-ALGORITHMS attribute. Because the nonce used in subsequent authenticated transactions is verified by the server to be identical to what was originally sent, it cannot be modified by an on-path attacker. Additionally, the client is mandated to copy the received PASSWORD-ALGORITHMS attribute in the next authenticated transaction to that server.

A client using an older version of this protocol will not send the PASSWORD-ALGORITHMS back but can only use MD5 anyway, so the attack is inconsequential.

            SHA-256 was chosen as the new default for password hashing for its compatibility with [RFC7616], but because SHA-256 (like MD5) is a comparatively fast algorithm, it does little to deter brute-force attacks. Specifically, this means that if the user has a weak password, an attacker that captures a single exchange can use a brute-force attack to learn the user&#39;s password and then potentially impersonate the user to the server and to other servers where the same password was used. Note that such an attacker can impersonate the user to the server itself without any brute-force attack.

            The bid-down defenses in this protocol prevent an attacker from forcing the client and server to complete a handshake using weaker algorithms than they jointly support, but only if the weakest joint algorithm is strong enough that it cannot be compromised by a brute-force attack. However, this does not defend against many attacks on those algorithms; specifically, an on-path attacker might perform a bid-down attack on a client that supports both Argon2 [Argon2] and SHA-256 for password hashing and use that to collect a MESSAGE-INTEGRITY-SHA256 value that it can then use for an offline brute-force attack. This would be detected when the server receives the second request, but that does not prevent the attacker from obtaining the MESSAGE-INTEGRITY-SHA256 value.

            Similarly, an attack against the USERHASH mechanism will not succeed in establishing a session as the server will detect that the feature was discarded on path, but the client would still have been convinced to send its username in the clear in the USERNAME attribute, thus disclosing it to the attacker.

            reflexive address is a function of the usage, the applicability and remediation of these attacks are usage-specific. In common situations, modification of the reflexive address by an on-path attacker is easy to do. Consider, for example, the common situation where STUN is run directly over UDP. In this case, an on-path attacker can modify the source IP address of the Binding request before it arrives at the STUN server. The STUN server will then return this IP address in the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute to the client and send the response back to that (falsified) IP address and port. If the attacker can also intercept this response, it can direct it back towards the client. Protecting against this attack by using a message-integrity check is impossible, since a message-integrity value cannot cover the source IP address and the intervening NAT must be able to modify this value. Instead, one solution to prevent the attacks listed below is for the client to verify the reflexive address learned, as is done in ICE [RFC8445].

This attack can provide substantial amplification, especially when used with clients that are using STUN to enable multimedia applications.

As a result, the client won&#39;t receive any of the packets it expects to receive when it hands out the reflexive address. This exploitation is not very interesting for the attacker. It impacts a single client, which is frequently not the desired target. Moreover, any attacker that can mount the attack could also deny service to the client by other means, such as preventing the client from receiving any response from the STUN server, or even a DHCP server.

In most cases (such as when the attack is launched from an access network), this means that the attacker could already observe packets sent to the client. This attack is, as a result, only useful for observing traffic by attackers on the path from the client to the STUN server, but not generally on the path of packets being routed towards the client.

            The IAB has studied the problem of Unilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF), which is the general process by which a client attempts to determine its address in another realm on the other side of a NAT through a collaborative protocol reflection mechanism [RFC3424]. STUN can be used to perform this function using a Binding request/ response transaction if one agent is behind a NAT and the other is on the public side of the NAT.
