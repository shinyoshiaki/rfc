            Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses. Receivers may use the base mechanisms of the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term. This is the sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec-specific mechanisms). This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus allows for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented. This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups.

            Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses. RTP [1] provides all the necessary mechanisms to restore ordering and timing present at the sender to properly reproduce a media stream at a recipient. RTP also provides continuous feedback about the overall reception quality from all receivers -- thereby allowing the sender(s) in the mid-term (in the order of several seconds to minutes) to adapt their coding scheme and transmission behavior to the observed network quality of service (QoS). However, except for a few payload-specific mechanisms [6], RTP makes no provision for timely feedback that would allow a sender to repair the media stream immediately: through retransmissions, retroactive Forward Error Correction (FEC) control, or media-specific mechanisms for some video codecs, such as reference picture selection.

          <p class="text indent-3">
            Current mechanisms available with RTP to improve error resilience include audio redundancy coding [13], video redundancy coding [14], RTP-level FEC [11], and general considerations on more robust media streams transmission [12]. These mechanisms may be applied proactively (thereby increasing the bandwidth of a given media stream). Alternatively, in sufficiently small groups with small round-trip times (RTTs), the senders may perform repair on-demand, using the above mechanisms and/or media-encoding-specific approaches. Note that &#34;small group&#34; and &#34;sufficiently small RTT&#34; are both highly application dependent.

            This document specifies a modified RTP profile for audio and video conferences with minimal control based upon [1] and [2] by means of two modifications/additions: Firstly, to achieve timely feedback, the concept of Early RTCP messages as well as algorithms allowing for low-delay feedback in small multicast groups (and preventing feedback implosion in large ones) are introduced. Special consideration is given to point-to-point scenarios. Secondly, a small number of general-purpose feedback messages as well as a format for codec- and application-specific feedback information are defined for transmission in the RTCP payloads.

            The definitions from RTP/RTCP [1] and the &#34;RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control&#34; [2] apply. In addition, the following definitions are used in this document: Early RTCP mode: The mode of operation in that a receiver of a media stream is often (but not always) capable of reporting events of interest back to the sender close to their occurrence. In Early RTCP mode, RTCP packets are transmitted according to the timing rules defined in this document.

            Early RTCP packet: An Early RTCP packet is a packet which is transmitted earlier than would be allowed if following the scheduling algorithm of [1], the reason being an &#34;event&#34; observed by a receiver. Early RTCP packets may be sent in Immediate Feedback and in Early RTCP mode. Sending an Early RTCP packet is also referred to as sending Early Feedback in this document.

            Event: An observation made by the receiver of a media stream that is (potentially) of interest to the sender -- such as a packet loss or packet reception, frame loss, etc. -- and thus useful to be reported back to the sender by means of a feedback message.

            Feedback (FB) threshold: The FB threshold indicates the transition between Immediate Feedback and Early RTCP mode. For a multiparty scenario, the FB threshold indicates the maximum group size at which, on average, each receiver is able to report each event back to the sender(s) immediately, i.e., by means of an Early RTCP packet without having to wait for its regularly scheduled RTCP interval. This threshold is highly dependent on the type of feedback to be provided, network QoS (e.g., packet loss probability and distribution), codec and packetization scheme in use, the session bandwidth, and application requirements. Note that the algorithms do not depend on all senders and receivers agreeing on the same value for this threshold. It is merely intended to provide conceptual guidance to application designers and is not used in any calculations. For the sake of clarity, the term feedback threshold is referred to as FB threshold throughout this document.

The RTCP-based feedback defined in this memo is able to provide minimal support for limited error repair. As RTCP feedback is not guaranteed to operate on sufficiently small timescales (in the order of RTT), RTCP feedback is not suitable to support congestion control.

            FB messages are part of the RTCP control streams and thus subject to the RTCP bandwidth constraints. This means, in particular, that it may not be possible to report an event observed at a receiver immediately back to the sender. However, the value of feedback given to a sender typically decreases over time -- in terms of the media quality as perceived by the user at the receiving end and/or the cost required to achieve media stream repair.

            RTP [1] and the commonly used RTP profile [2] specify rules when compound RTCP packets should be sent. This document modifies those rules in order to allow applications to timely report events (e.g., loss or reception of RTP packets) and to accommodate algorithms that use FB messages.

            The modified RTCP transmission algorithm can be outlined as follows: As long as no FB messages have to be conveyed, compound RTCP packets are sent following the rules of RTP [1] -- except that the five-second minimum interval between RTCP reports is not enforced. Hence, the interval between RTCP reports is only derived from the average RTCP packet size and the RTCP bandwidth share available to the RTP/RTCP entity. Optionally, a minimum interval between Regular RTCP packets may be enforced.

            If a receiver detects the need to send an FB message, it may do so earlier than the next regular RTCP reporting interval (for which it would be scheduled following the above regular RTCP algorithm). Feedback suppression is used to avoid feedback implosion in multiparty sessions: The receiver waits for a (short) random dithering interval to check whether it sees a corresponding FB message from any other receiver reporting the same event. Note that for point-to-point sessions there is no such delay. If a corresponding FB message from another member is received, this receiver refrains from sending the FB message and continues to follow the Regular RTCP transmission schedule. In case the receiver has not yet seen a corresponding FB message from any other member, it checks whether it is allowed to send Early feedback. If sending Early feedback is permissible, the receiver sends the FB message as part of a minimal compound RTCP packet. The permission to send Early feedback depends on the type of the previous RTCP packet sent by this receiver and the time the previous Early feedback message was sent.

            a) Immediate Feedback mode: In this mode, the group size is below the FB threshold, which gives each receiving party sufficient bandwidth to transmit the RTCP feedback packets for the intended purpose. This means that, for each receiver, there is enough bandwidth to report each event by means of a virtually &#34;immediate&#34; RTCP feedback packet.

            The group size threshold is a function of a number of parameters including (but not necessarily limited to): the type of feedback used (e.g., ACK vs. NACK), bandwidth, packet rate, packet loss probability and distribution, media type, codec, and the (worst case or observed) frequency of events to report (e.g., frame received, packet lost).

This information can be used as a hint to determine whether or not early transmission of RTCP packets is useful.

            For unidirectional as well as bi-directional communication between two parties, 2.5% of the RTP session bandwidth is available for RTCP traffic from the receivers including feedback. For a 64-kbit/s stream this yields 1,600 bit/s for RTCP. If we assume an average of 96 bytes (=768 bits) per RTCP packet, a receiver can report 2 events per second back to the sender. If acknowledgements for 10 events are collected in each FB message, then 20 events can be acknowledged per second.

            The most important parameters when determining the mode of operation are the allowed minimal interval between two compound RTCP packets (T_rr) and the average number of events that presumably need reporting per time interval (plus their distribution over time, of course). The minimum interval can be derived from the available RTCP bandwidth and the expected average size of an RTCP packet. The number of events to report (e.g., per second) may be derived from the packet loss rate and sender&#39;s rate of transmitting packets.

            Example: If a 256-kbit/s video with 30 fps is transmitted through a network with an MTU size of some 1,500 bytes, then, in most cases, each frame would fit in into one packet leading to a packet rate of 30 packets per second. If 5% packet loss occurs in the network (equally distributed, no inter-dependence between receivers), then each receiver will, on average, have to report 3 packets lost each two seconds. Assuming a single sender and more than three receivers, this yields 3.75% of the RTCP bandwidth allocated to the receivers and thus 9.6 kbit/s. Assuming further a size of 120 bytes for the average compound RTCP packet allows 10 RTCP packets to be sent per second or 20 in two seconds. If every receiver needs to report three lost packets per two seconds, this yields a maximum group size of 6-7 receivers if all loss events are reported. The rules for transmission of Early RTCP packets should provide sufficient flexibility for most of this reporting to occur in a timely fashion.

            Extending this example to determine the upper bound for Early RTCP mode could lead to the following considerations: assume that the underlying coding scheme and the application (as well as the tolerant users) allow on the order of one loss without repair per two seconds. Thus, the number of packets to be reported by each receiver decreases to two per two seconds and increases the group size to 10. Assuming further that some number of packet losses are correlated, feedback traffic is further reduced and group sizes of some 12 to 16 (maybe even 20) can be reasonably well supported using Early RTCP mode. Note that all these considerations are based upon statistics and will fail to hold in some cases.

            This allows sender and receiver to provide reliable transmission of DTMF events in an audio session. Assuming a 64-kbit/s audio stream with one receiver, the receiver has 2.5% RTCP bandwidth available for the negative acknowledgement stream, i.e., 250 bytes per second or some 2 RTCP feedback messages every second. Hence, the receiver can individually communicate up to two missing DTMF audio packets per second.

            AVP senders will receive RTCP feedback packets from AVPF receivers and ignore these packets. They will see occasional closer spacing of RTCP messages (e.g., violating the five-second rule) by AVPF entities. As the overall bandwidth constraints are adhered to by both types of entities, they will still get their share of the RTCP bandwidth. However, while AVP entities are bound by the five-second rule, depending on the group size and session bandwidth, AVPF entities may provide more frequent RTCP reports than AVP ones will. Also, the overall reporting may decrease slightly as AVPF entities may send bigger compound RTCP packets (due to the extra RTCP packets).

            Transport layer FB messages are intended to transmit general purpose feedback information, i.e., information independent of the particular codec or the application in use. The information is expected to be generated and processed at the transport/RTP layer. Currently, only a generic negative acknowledgement (NACK) message is defined.

            Application layer FB messages provide a means to transparently convey feedback from the receiver&#39;s to the sender&#39;s application. The information contained in such a message is not expected to be acted upon at the transport/RTP or the codec layer. The data to be exchanged between two application instances is usually defined in the application protocol specification and thus can be identified by the application so that there is no need for additional external information. Hence, this document defines only a common header to be used along with all application layer FB messages. From a protocol point of view, an application layer FB message is treated as a special case of a payload-specific FB message.

            Note: Proper processing of some FB messages at the media sender side may require the sender to know which payload type the FB message refers to. Most of the time, this knowledge can likely be derived from a media stream using only a single payload type. However, if several codecs are used simultaneously (e.g., with audio and DTMF) or when codec changes occur, the payload type information may need to be conveyed explicitly as part of the FB message. This applies to all payload-specific as well as application layer FB messages. It is up to the specification of an FB message to define how payload type information is transmitted.

Denoting the BLP&#39;s least significant bit as bit 1, and its most significant bit as bit 16, then bit i of the bit mask is set to 1 if the receiver has not received RTP packet number (PID+i) (modulo 2^16) and indicates this packet is lost; bit i is set to 0 otherwise.

For example, the least significant bit of the BLP would be set to 1 if the packet corresponding to the PID and the following packet have been lost. However, the sender cannot infer that packets PID+2 through PID+16 have been received simply because bits 2 through 15 of the BLP are 0; all the sender knows is that the receiver has not reported them as lost at this time.

            With the Picture Loss Indication message, a decoder informs the encoder about the loss of an undefined amount of coded video data belonging to one or more pictures. When used in conjunction with any video coding scheme that is based on inter-picture prediction, an encoder that receives a PLI becomes aware that the prediction chain may be broken. The sender MAY react to a PLI by transmitting an intra-picture to achieve resynchronization (making this message effectively similar to the FIR message as defined in [6]); however, the sender MUST consider congestion control as outlined in Section 7, which MAY restrict its ability to send an intra frame.

            PLI messages typically trigger the sending of full intra-pictures. Intra-pictures are several times larger then predicted (inter-) pictures. Their size is independent of the time they are generated. In most environments, especially when employing bandwidth-limited links, the use of an intra-picture implies an allowed delay that is a significant multitude of the typical frame duration. An example: If the sending frame rate is 10 fps, and an intra-picture is assumed to be 10 times as big as an inter-picture, then a full second of latency has to be accepted. In such an environment, there is no need for a particular short delay in sending the FB message. Hence, waiting for the next possible time slot allowed by RTCP timing rules as per [2] with Tmin=0 does not have a negative impact on the system performance.

            The term Slice is defined and used here in the sense of MPEG-1 -- a consecutive number of macroblocks in scan order. More recent video coding standards sometimes have a different understanding of the term Slice. In H.263 (1998), for example, a concept known as &#34;rectangular slice&#34; exists. The loss of one rectangular slice may lead to the necessity of sending more than one SLI in order to precisely identify the region of lost/damaged MBs.

            The first field of the FCI defines the first macroblock of a picture as 1 and not, as one could suspect, as 0. This was done to align this specification with the comparable mechanism available in ITU-T Rec. H.245 [24]. The maximum number of macroblocks in a picture (2**13 or 8192) corresponds to the maximum picture sizes of most of the ITU-T and ISO/IEC video codecs. If future video codecs offer larger picture sizes and/or smaller macroblock sizes, then an additional FB message has to be defined. The six least significant bits of the Temporal Reference field are deemed to be sufficient to indicate the picture in which the loss occurred.

            Algorithms were reported that keep track of the regions affected by motion compensation, in order to allow for a transmission of Intra macroblocks to all those areas, regardless of the timing of the FB (see H.263 (2000) Appendix I [17] and [15]). Although the timing of the FB is less critical when those algorithms are used than if they are not, it has to be observed that those algorithms correct large parts of the picture and, therefore, have to transmit much higher data volume in case of delayed FBs.

            Modern video coding standards such as MPEG-4 visual version 2 [16] or H.263 version 2 [17] allow using older reference pictures than the most recent one for predictive coding. Typically, a first-in-first-out queue of reference pictures is maintained. If an encoder has learned about a loss of encoder-decoder synchronicity, a known-as-correct reference picture can be used. As this reference picture is temporally further away then usual, the resulting predictively coded picture will use more bits.

            RPSI is even more critical to delay than algorithms using SLI. This is because the older the RPSI message is, the more bits the encoder has to spend to re-establish encoder-decoder synchronicity.

            Application layer FB messages are a special case of payload-specific messages and are identified by PT=PSFB and FMT=15. There MUST be exactly one application layer FB message contained in the FCI field, unless the application layer FB message structure itself allows for stacking (e.g., by means of a fixed size or explicit length indicator).

            These messages are used to transport application-defined data directly from the receiver&#39;s to the sender&#39;s application. The data that is transported is not identified by the FB message. Therefore, the application MUST be able to identify the message payload.

            Usually, applications define their own set of messages, e.g., NEWPRED messages in MPEG-4 [16] (carried in RTP packets according to RFC 3016 [23]) or FB messages in H.263/Annex N, U [17] (packetized as per RFC 2429 [14]). These messages do not need any additional information from the RTCP message. Thus, the application message is simply placed into the FCI field as follows and the length field is set accordingly.

Identification of padding is up to the application layer and not defined in this specification.

            In the previous sections, the FB messages were defined as well as the timing rules according to which to send these messages. The way to react to the feedback received depends on the application using the feedback mechanisms and hence is beyond the scope of this document.

            However, across all applications, there is a common requirement for (TCP-friendly) congestion control on the media stream as defined in [1] and [2] when operating in a best-effort network environment.

            It should be noted that RTCP feedback itself is insufficient for congestion control purposes as it is likely to operate at much slower timescales than other transport layer feedback mechanisms (that usually operate in the order of RTT). Therefore, additional mechanisms are required to perform proper congestion control.

            RTP packets transporting information with the proposed payload format are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP specification [1] and in the RTP/AVP profile specification [2]. This profile does not specify any additional security services.

          <p class="text indent-3">
            This profile modifies the timing behavior of RTCP and eliminates the minimum RTCP interval of five seconds and allows for earlier feedback to be provided by receivers. Group members of the associated RTP session (possibly pretending to represent a large number of entities) may disturb the operation of RTCP by sending large numbers of RTCP packets thereby reducing the RTCP bandwidth available for Regular RTCP reporting as well as for Early FB messages. (Note that an entity need not be a member of a multicast group to cause these effects.) Similarly, malicious members may send very large RTCP messages, thereby increasing the avg_rtcp_size variable and reducing the effectively available RTCP bandwidth.

          <p class="text indent-3">
            Feedback information may be suppressed if unknown RTCP feedback packets are received. This introduces the risk of a malicious group member reducing Early feedback by simply transmitting payload-specific RTCP feedback packets with random contents that are not recognized by any receiver (so they will suppress feedback) or by the sender (so no repair actions will be taken).

          <p class="text indent-3">
            A malicious group member can also report arbitrary high loss rates in the feedback information to make the sender throttle the data transmission and increase the amount of redundancy information or take other action to deal with the pretended packet loss (e.g., send fewer frames or decrease audio/video quality). This may result in a degradation of the quality of the reproduced media stream.

            Finally, a malicious group member can act as a large number of group members and thereby obtain an artificially large share of the Early feedback bandwidth and reduce the reactivity of the other group members -- possibly even causing them to no longer operate in Immediate or Early feedback mode and thus undermining the whole purpose of this profile.

            Senders as well as receivers SHOULD behave conservatively when observing strange reporting behavior. For excessive failure reporting from one or a few receivers, the sender MAY decide to no longer consider this feedback when adapting its transmission behavior for the media stream. In any case, senders and receivers SHOULD still adhere to the maximum RTCP bandwidth but make sure that they are capable of transmitting at least regularly scheduled RTCP packets. Senders SHOULD carefully consider how to adjust their transmission bandwidth when encountering strange reporting behavior; they MUST NOT increase their transmission bandwidth even if ignoring suspicious feedback.

            Attacks using false RTCP packets (Regular as well as Early ones) can be avoided by authenticating all RTCP messages. This can be achieved by using the AVPF profile together with the Secure RTP profile as defined in [22]; as a prerequisite, an appropriate combination of those two profiles (an &#34;SAVPF&#34;) is being specified [21]. Note that, when employing group authentication (as opposed to source authentication), the aforementioned attacks may be carried out by malicious or malfunctioning group members in possession of the right keying material.

            Further entries may be registered following the &#34;Specification Required&#34; rules as defined in RFC 2434 [9]. Each registration needs to indicate the FMT value, if there is a specific FB message to go into the FCI field, and whether or not multiple FB messages may be stacked in a single FCI field. For each new registration, it is mandatory that a permanent, stable, and publicly accessible document exists that specifies the semantics of the registered parameter as well as the syntax and semantics of the associated FB message (if any). The general registration procedures of [3] apply.
