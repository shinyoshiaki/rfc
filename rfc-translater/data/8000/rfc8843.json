BUNDLE does not change which information, e.g., RTP streams, flows over the network, with the exception of the usage of the MID SDES item as discussed below. Primarily, it changes which addresses and ports, and thus in which (RTP) sessions, the information flows to. This affects the security contexts being used and can cause previously separated information flows to share the same security context. This has very little impact on the performance of the security mechanism of the RTP sessions. In cases where one would have applied different security policies on the different RTP streams being bundled, or where the parties having access to the security contexts would have differed between the RTP streams, additional analysis of the implications are needed before selecting to apply BUNDLE."

Therefore, the identification-tag values MUST be generated in a fashion that does not leak user information, e.g., randomly or using a per-bundle group counter, and SHOULD be 3 bytes or less to allow them to efficiently fit into the MID RTP header extension. Note that if implementations use different methods for generating identification-tags, this could enable fingerprinting of the implementation making it vulnerable to targeted attacks. The identification-tag is exposed on the RTP stream level when included in the RTP header extensions; however, what it reveals of the RTP media stream structure of the endpoint and application was already possible to deduce from the RTP streams without the MID SDES header extensions. As the identification-tag is also used to route the media stream to the right application functionality, it is important that the value received is the one intended by the sender; thus, integrity and the authenticity of the source are important to prevent denial of service on the application. Existing SRTP configurations and other security mechanisms protecting the whole RTP/RTCP packets will provide the necessary protection."

However, assuming the above requirements and recommendations are followed, there are no known significant security risks with leaving the MID RTP header extension without confidentiality protection. Therefore, this specification updates RFC 7941 by adding the exception that this requirement MAY be ignored for the MID RTP header extension. Security mechanisms for RTP/RTCP are discussed in \"Options for Securing RTP Sessions\" [RFC7201], for example, SRTP [RFC3711] can provide the necessary security functions of ensuring the integrity and source authenticity."

It is worth noting that a B2BUA that generated an Offer with capabilities it does not understand is not compliant with the specifications."

There might be rules that will trigger a session to be terminated in case media is not sent or received on the ports retrieved from the SDP. This typically occurs once the session is already established and ongoing."

If the client only wants to generate Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) or STUN ICE candidates for one of the \"m=\" lines and then use Trickle ICE [RFC8838] to get the non-host ICE candidates for the rest of the \"m=\" sections, it MAY do that and will not need any additional gathering time."
