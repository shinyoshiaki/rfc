These allow negotiating the use of specific curves and point formats (e.g., compressed vs. uncompressed, respectively) during a handshake starting a new session. These extensions are especially relevant for constrained clients that may only support a limited number of curves or point formats. They follow the general approach outlined in [4]; message details are specified in Section 5. The client enumerates the curves it supports and the point formats it can parse by including the appropriate extensions in its ClientHello message. The server similarly enumerates the point formats it can parse by including an extension in its ServerHello message."

    },
    {
      "indent": 3,
      "text": "Beyond elliptic curve size, the main issue is elliptic curve structure. As a general principle, it is more conservative to use elliptic curves with as little algebraic structure as possible. Thus, random curves are more conservative than special curves such as Koblitz curves, and curves over F_p with p random are more conservative than curves over F_p with p of a special form (and curves over F_p with p random might be considered more conservative than curves over F_2^m as there is no choice between multiple fields of similar size for characteristic 2). Note, however, that algebraic structure can also lead to implementation efficiencies, and implementers and users may, therefore, need to balance conservatism against a need for efficiency. Concrete attacks are known against only very few special classes of curves, such as supersingular curves, and these classes are excluded from the ECC standards that this document references [6], [7]."
    },
    {
      "indent": 3,
      "text": "Another issue is the potential for catastrophic failures when a single elliptic curve is widely used. In this case, an attack on the elliptic curve might result in the compromise of a large number of keys. Again, this concern may need to be balanced against efficiency and interoperability improvements associated with widely-used curves. Substantial additional information on elliptic curve choice can be found in [5], [6], [7], and [11]."
    },
    {
      "indent": 3,
      "text": "Implementers and users must also consider whether they need forward secrecy. Forward secrecy refers to the property that session keys are not compromised if the static, certified keys belonging to the server and client are compromised. The ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA key exchange algorithms provide forward secrecy protection in the event of server key compromise, while ECDH_ECDSA and ECDH_RSA do not. Similarly, if the client is providing a static, certified key, ECDSA_sign client authentication provides forward secrecy protection in the event of client key compromise, while ECDSA_fixed_ECDH and RSA_fixed_ECDH do not. Thus, to obtain complete forward secrecy protection, ECDHE_ECDSA or ECDHE_RSA must be used for key exchange, with ECDSA_sign used for client authentication if necessary. Here again the security benefits of forward secrecy may need to be balanced against the improved efficiency offered by other options."
